Badger::Class
-------------

* finish cleanup and documentation

* pkg() alias for name()

* AUTOLOAD method to delegate to real class if possible?


Badger::Codec
--------------

* encoded()/decoded() methods (e.g. for utf8)


Badger::Config
--------------

* Just a basic implementation at moment.  Merge in TT3 config, AppConfig
  and other stuff.


Badger::Debug
-------------

* move in debug() from Badger::Base and make it a mixin.


Badger::Exception
-----------------

* needs good cleanup


Badger::Filesystem
------------------

* documentation

* exists() should check the type for file/dir

* directory files/directories/dirs

* virtual filesystems composed across several real filesystems


Badger::Storage
---------------

* unify parameter parsing and identity definition between filesystem and
  database storage modules.

* get/put which take data / return id

* fetch/store which returns 

* create/destroy   connect/disconnect  open/close


Badger::Test
------------

* Could do with some proper testing.  Although all the other test scripts
  do tend to thrash it quite well...


Misc
----

* Move Badger::Exception to Badger::Error and clean out.  Hmm... nah, 
  maybe not.
